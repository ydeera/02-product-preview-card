## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox & Grid
- Pesticide -- A powerful Chrome plugin

### What I learned

- Solve problems before coding.
- A easy way to center items horizontally&vertically in `body`: set `min-height: 100vh`, so that the `body`tag will stretch to all viewport, change `display` (flex or grid), then just use `justify-content: center` and `align-items: center`!
- `margin-top` and `margin-bottom` have no effect on non-replaced inline elements.(So I changed `display` of "$169.99" to `block` to apply `margin-top`)
