## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Pesticide -- A powerful Chrome plugin

### What I learned

- Solve problems before coding
- A easy way to center items horizontally&vertically in <body>: set <min-height: 100vh>, so that the <body> tag will stretch to all viewport, change <display> (flex or grid), then just use <justify-content: center> and <align-items: center>!


## Acknowledgments
